Questions:
is the effect of terror an activated effect? NO!
    (and they're called abilities...)

add a target action
    untargetable exception

split effects by whether they use the stack (statics dont need setTargets method
    globals really dont aswell. figure it out)

pass source to actions

avoid NPE in removePlayer destroyAll source

what about color/type checking?
    passing the source would be an option -> check inside action
        only real way to avoid massive redundancy inside various effets
            literally every effect would have to pass color/type specific conditions (shit!)
    occurs when targeting/damaging/destroying/attacking/blocking

check validity and costs when playing an ability

resolvecard:
    replace battlefield.add with "putIntoPlay" action
