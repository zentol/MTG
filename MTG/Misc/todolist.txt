maybe write tests for all things?
    with all the changes to constructors that would be REALLY painful...

separate conditions for specific actions (targetable,destructible)

Milestones:
    triggers
    combat
        
check validity and costs when playing an ability

rework resolving of spells/permanents
    spells:

turn
    phases
        see code
        
combat
    basic implementation
        attacking
        blocking
            track which creature is getting blocked
    damage model
    
Stack
    spellspeed
    resolve spells

Effects
    costs
        extend from activated effect
        abstract method payCost()
    global effects
    triggers
        global triggers
    periodic effect validity checking

Actions
    attack
    block

Trigger
    At the beginning of upkeep/combat/etc.
    enter the battlefield(conditions (green creature/etc.))
    card drawn/discarded
    damage dealt
    card played(conditions)

Conditions
    Effect
        isActivatedEffect
