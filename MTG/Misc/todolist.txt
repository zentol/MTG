Questions:
is the effect of terror an activated effect? NO!
    (and they're called abilities...)

add a target action
    untargetable exception
add a (un)tap action

move action specific conditions into actions (i.e. destroy must check ConditionDestructible)
what about color/type checking?
    passing the source would be an option -> check inside action
        only real way to avoid massive redundancy inside various effets
            literally every effect would have to pass color/type specific conditions (shit!)
    

passed conditions would have to include the sources type(s), colors, names, attack/defense etc.
maybe rather check against static effects.(this would require reflections though...)
    Not necessarily, statics could have an abstract prohibits(card source) 
    method that evaluates these conditions
