Questions:
is the effect of terror an activated effect? NO!
    (and they're called abilities...)

rework destroy to use a single destroy method. pass instanceID as ConditionIsTarget
    nah thats shitty. this would mean searching through the whole battlefield each time.

add a target action
    untargetable exception

targetable: check for type/subtype

split Protection into damage/target/block component

pass source to actions

avoid NPE in removePlayer destroyAll source

what about color/type checking?
    passing the source would be an option -> check inside action
        only real way to avoid massive redundancy inside various effets
            literally every effect would have to pass color/type specific conditions (shit!)
    occurs when targeting/damaging/destroying/attacking/blocking

check validity and costs when playing an ability
