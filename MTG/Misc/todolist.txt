Milestones:
    triggers
    combat

modifier placement: 
    instead of applying global effects to every card, why not check the 
    field for certain modifiers based on the action/condition performed?
        1.global effects still need modifiers
        2.differentiate between local/global modifiers
    con:
        loses global scope. taking the modifiers effect on 
        multiple targets into account would be a bitch
