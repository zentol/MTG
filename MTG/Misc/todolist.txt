rework effect.activate():
    targets chosen inside (validated right away)
        currently done in Action.Play.addEffectToStack
        which is better? actions is more centric (choosing targets is an action performed for ALL targeting spells)

separate conditions for specific actions (tapable)

selectTargets():
    when adding this action, the effects' conditions are not accessible
        except when passing source
        (int targetCount, Condition[] conditions)?
            immediate validation makes target checks kind of unnecessary
    "dumb" method, selects cards, validation afterwards, if activation fails redo selection
    => requires activate to e called from method encapsuling select
        well thats supported right now ;)

add targetCount to effects
