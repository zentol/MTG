pass source to actions

avoid NPE in removePlayer destroyAll source

what about color/type checking?
    passing the source would be an option -> check inside action
        only real way to avoid massive redundancy inside various effets
            literally every effect would have to pass color/type specific conditions (shit!)
    occurs when targeting/damaging/destroying/attacking/blocking

check validity and costs when playing an ability
