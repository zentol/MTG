Milestones:
    triggers
    combat

modifier placement: 
    instead of applying global effects to every card, why not check the 
    field for certain modifiers based on the action/condition performed?
        1.global effects still need modifiers
        2.differentiate between local/global modifiers
    con:
        loses global scope. taking the modifiers effect on 
        multiple targets into account would be a bitch
    differentiation between local/global still necessary(?) though
    globals implement apply() method, checking the field for valid targets
        or - reexecute() all statics -> take care they arent applied multiple times :/
            cant differentiate by class, some modifiers rely on this
            modifier id?hmm...effectid+sourceid should be fairly specific
            effect id would be enough
    is this even necessary? static modifiers dont just disappear. 
        whenever a permanent is altered, modifiers get reevaluated. 
        (need reevaluate function?->inherit conditions from source effect
            or save the effect instead of source card (source is saved transitiv))                                                        
        if this is properly done i dont have to worry about applying stuff multiple times
